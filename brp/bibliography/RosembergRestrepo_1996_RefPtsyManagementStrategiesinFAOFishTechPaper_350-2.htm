<p>Precautionary management reference points are those intended to prevent recruitment overfishing,
even if a direct link between spawning stock size and subsequent recruitment cannot be established
statistically. In order to be precautionary, the appropriate null hypothesis is that the stock does
not compensate for reduced abundance by increasing productivity. There are many limit reference
points that can be used to prevent recruitment overfishing. However, it is unlikely that a single
limit reference point can provide protection for the resource under all foreseeable circumstances
and, thus, it is useful to define harvest control laws which combine several thresholds. A
precautionary management strategy should contain, in addition to limit reference points, a priori
decision rules on the acceptable probability (risk) that recruitment overfishing will take place,
given the target harvest and the estimated stock status. The choice for a particular definition of
risk should be tied to uncertainty and precautionary management dictates that more uncertain
situations require more conservative measures.</p>

<h2><a name="ch4.1">INTRODUCTION</a></h2>

<p>The precautionary approach to fishery management, as described by Garcia (1994) seeks to
protect fishery resources from fishing practices which might put their long-term viability in jeopardy.
In order to take appropriate precaution, fishing activities may need to be controlled even before there
is clear scientific evidence that current practices can not be sustained by the resource. In order to
develop fishery control policies, biological reference points are needed for measuring current resource
status and the projected effects of fishing.</p>

<p>Biological reference points (BRP) have long been used in fishery management as benchmarks
for the development of management strategies. The most widely cited such benchmark is maximum
sustainable yield, often thought of as a default management objective from a biological perspective
(Hilborn and Walters 1992). Biological reference points really are not objectives in and of
themselves, however, but quantitative indicators of variables such as fishing mortality rate, yield or
stock biomass by which the current state of the fishery can be judged. For example, if the objective
is to obtain the largest possible yield on an ongoing basis from a resource, comparing the time stream
of catches to the estimated level of MSY and its uncertainty may indicate if the objective is being
achieved over time. Alternatively, a management strategy to approach the objective may be based
on estimates of MSY and its uncertainty as well as on other aspects of the dynamics of the resource
and the fishery. In the first instance, the reference point, MSY, is used retrospectively to evaluate
past performance. In the latter example, it is used prospectively for the development of future
management tactics. These two usages of biological references points are needed for both developing
and developed fisheries.</p>

<p>There are a very wide variety of reference points available as bechmarks for different
management objectives. For most fisheries, more than one reference point is needed to outline the
overall management strategy. FAO (1993) describes most of the commonly applied reference points
and that summary will not be repeated here. Exceeding a reference can, in one way or another, be
classified as overfishing. However, overfishing can take a number of forms; for example, target
overfishing, growth overfishing, recruitment overfishing, and economic overfishing. While the first
type of overfishing is associated with a <i>target</i>, growth and recruitment overfishing are generally
associated with <i>thresholds</i> or limit reference points (FAO 1993), and economic overfishing may be
expressed in terms of either targets or limits, depending on the definition used. The difference is that
while fishing activity is expected to fluctuate about targets, limits should generally not be crossed.
Strictly, target overfishing could be said to occur whenever the target is overshot; however, small
deviations would not generally be considered serious until and unless a consistent bias became
apparent. Conversely, even a single violation of a limit reference point may indicate the need for
immediate action to reduce fishing mortality.</p>

<p>For the development and evaluation of precautionary management strategies, limit reference
points for biological conservation are the most important, to set the constraints within which the
management strategy must operate. In particular, to maintain a sustainable resource recruitment
overfishing must be protected against, and precautionary management would seek prevent recruitment
declines due to overharvesting even if the scientific evidence of the impact of fishing is weak and a
causal link has not been established. Fishing effects on recruitment may be related to such factors
as habitat loss, disturbance of egg beds or harvesting of prerecruits, but the major factor in most
fisheries is the relationship between the spawners or the eggs they produce and the recruitment of
young fish to the fishable or spawning population. The relationship between spawning stock or other
factors and recruitment may be weak in many cases, but must exist in the limit as the number of
spawners is reduced to very low levels. In a study of empirical stock-recruitment data sets from
around the world, Myers and Barrowman (1994) found that lower stock sizes were generally
associated with lower recruitment levels. In order to be precautionary, the appropriate null hypothesis
is that spawning biomass or egg production is linearly related to subsequent recruitment (Fogarty et
al. 1992). That is, that the population does not compensate for increasing mortality or reduced
abundance of adults by increasing productivity. Unfortunately, the lack of a clear relationship
between spawning stock and recruitment has led some fishery managers (and scientists !) to conclude
that the appropriate null hypothesis is a line with slope 0. Such a null hypothesis can result in
continued harvesting until a major decline in recruitment is observed at low biomass, the antithesis
of precaution.</p>

<h3><a name="ch4.1.1">1. LIMIT REFERENCE POINTS</a></h3>

<p>The need to define recruitment overfishing reference points has been largely neglected until
recent times, as the number and diversity of fisheries that are considered overfished continues to
increase. Even now, far fewer BRP's have been developed to identify recruitment overfishing than
to identify growth overfishing, and their generality is often questioned. Once F<sub>0.1</sub> was invented
(Gulland and Boerema 1973), fisheries scientists often advocated the use of F<sub>0.1</sub> as a target and F<sub>max</sub>
as a limit. Other early limit reference points included minimum spawning biomass levels based on
observed stock collapses, and 20% of the unfished stock biomass (20% B<sub>0</sub>; e.g., Beddington and
Cooke 1983). Alternative indicators of poor stock condition that have long been advocated are
truncated age distributions, small or decreasing mean size in landings, and a markedly declining
survey index, but these have rarely been articulated into measurable, unambiguous quantities.</p>

<p>Within the last 10 years, an important new class of reference points associated with
recruitment overfishing have been developed based on percentiles of survival ratios estimated from
stock and recruitment observations. This work began with Shepherd (1982), who showed how a
standard spawner per recruit (SPR) analysis could be combined with stock and recruitment
observations to generate reference fishing mortality rates. The relationship between the two types of
information is straightforward (Gabriel et al. 1989; Mace and Sissenwine 1993); for any constant F,
there is a corresponding SPR level that can be inverted and used as the slope of a straight line through
the origin of the stock and recruitment data. Points along the line represent the average survival ratio
(R/S) required to support that particular constant F. Percentiles of observed survival ratios can
therefore be used to define threshold and target levels of F, which can then be translated back to the
SPR scale (see Gabriel et al. 1989 for the computational details).</p>

<p>Two percentiles that have been advocated as reference points for overfishing thresholds are
the 90th percentile (denoted F<sub>high</sub>; Shepherd 1982) and the median (denoted F<sub>med</sub>; Sissenwine and
Shepherd 1987). Both are intended as indicators of <i>recruitment overfishing</i>. The tangent through the
origin of a stock and recruitment relationship corresponds to F<sub>extinction</sub>. F<sub>high</sub> may overestimate the
tangent, since the highest survival ratios may just reflect anomalously favorable environmental
conditions, not the ability of the population to sustain fishing under average environmental conditions.
On the other hand, F<sub>med</sub> may underestimate the slope if the data exhibit compensation (concavity).
It is more correct to use F<sub>med</sub> as an estimate of F<sub>rep</sub> (F-replacement), the fishing mortality rate
corresponding to the observed average survival ratio. Thus, F<sub>rep</sub> is the fishing mortality rate that, on
average, allows for replacement of successive generations over the observed range of stock and
recruitment data. F<sub>rep</sub> is a valid approximation of the slope at the origin in the case where the
observations are restricted to low stock size, or where there is little compensation in the relationship.
However, F<sub>rep</sub> may forego potential yield if the stock has a recent history of light exploitation, and
F<sub>med</sub> may underestimate F<sub>rep</sub> if the distribution of recruitment is highly skewed.</p>

<p>Mace and Sissenwine (1993) surveyed 91 well-studied European and North American fish
stocks with sufficient data to construct stock-recruitment plots and conduct yield per recruit and
spawning per recruit analyses to obtain estimates of reference points such as F<sub>0.1</sub>, F<sub>max</sub>, F<sub>med</sub> and
associated levels of %SPR. They estimated the median ratio of F<sub>med</sub>/F<sub>max</sub> at 1.3 and the median of
F<sub>med</sub>/F<sub>0.1</sub> at 2.3. The average %SPR corresponding to F<sub>0.1</sub> was 38%, the average %SPR
corresponding to F<sub>max</sub> was 21%, and the average %SPR corresponding to F<sub>med</sub> was 19%. Mace and
Sissenwine advocated use of 20% SPR as a recruitment overfishing threshold for stocks believed to
have average resilience and 30% SPR for little-known stocks. That study complements earlier
theoretical and empirical work by Goodyear (1977, 1980, 1989, 1993), Gabriel et al. (1989) and
Clark (1991) that has resulted in SPR becoming the most common basis for recruitment overfishing
reference points in U.S. fishery management plans (Rosenberg et al. 1993). The choice of reference
level is usually based on theoretical considerations and analogy with other stocks, such that most
definitions use either 20% SPR and 30% SPR as the recruitment overfishing reference point.</p>

<p>There have also been developments in the use of stock and recruitment observations to define
biomass reference points. Despite the fact that theoretical stock-recruitment curves (e.g., Ricker 1954,
Beverton and Holt 1957, Shepherd 1982) have been widely used for decades, there are no generally
accepted methods for calculating biomass thresholds from the parameters. Some methods require that
the data be fitted by theoretical relationships, whereas others are based on the observations themselves
(non-parametric methods). The latter includes subjective, visual approaches that may be able to
identify critical biomass levels below which recruitment appears to begin to decline rapidly. The
main problem with subjective methods is that they do not always give consistent answers, and are
often biased by the status quo.</p>

<p>Serebryakov (1991) and Shepherd (1991) suggested an objective, non-parametric method for
estimating a threshold biomass. They defined the threshold by the intersection of the upper 90th
percentile of the observed survival ratio and the upper 90th percentile of the recruitment observations.
This intersection approximates the minimum stock size within the range of the observations that,
based on the data, can be expected to be capable of producing a good year class when environmental
conditions are favorable for survival. Unfortunately, although this method generally performs well
based on several different types of evaluation criteria, it is extremely sensitive to the range of the data
observed (Myers et al. 1994), with the threshold tending to get revised downward as a stock is fished
down and new S-R observations are added.</p>

<p>A more common method of specifying biomass thresholds is to express them as a percentage
of the unfished, virgin biomass (%B<sub>0</sub>), most often using 20% B<sub>0</sub> as a default. However, it may be
difficult to estimate B<sub>0</sub> for stocks that have been fished down substantially from virgin levels. In
some cases, it may be reasonable to define virgin biomass as the point where the F=0 replacement
line intersects a fitted S-R relationship, or the average or median observed recruitment. This method
of estimation is likely to be less valid for stocks far below the virgin state, particularly if the
observations cover only the recent history of the fishery. Indeed, Myers et al. (1994) found that the
point of intersection often occurs well outside the range of observations, at stock sizes where 
density-dependent effects may well differ from those in operation during the period of observations.</p>

<p>Ideally, threshold levels of biomass should be based on the associated level of recruitment
relative to some reference level. Although some definitions of biomass thresholds refer to recruitment
levels, the association is often somewhat vague. For example, the Advisory Committee on Fishery
Management of the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea has adopted the process of
specifying the minimum biologically acceptable level (MBAL) of biomass, defined as the biomass
level below which the probability of poor recruitment increases as spawning biomass declines further.
In practice, there are no set standards for calculating MBAL levels, and &#8220;poor&#8221; recruitment has not
been defined explicitly.</p>

<p>Few BRP's have been expressed in terms of recruitment, <i>per se</i>. One possibility that has
recently been suggested by Mace (1993) is to define a threshold biomass which corresponds to the
point on the SRR where expected recruitment is 50% of the maximum. A model presented by
Thompson (1993b) supports the use of the 50% recruitment level in that 50% is the maximum
reduction in recruitment that could be observed in equilibrium for a stock that is fished at the MSY
rate. Myers et al. (1994) evaluated this reference point for 72 sets of stock-recruitment data from
around the world. Although these analyses all measure relative recruitment in terms of the underlying
(deterministic) stock-recruitment relationship, the 50% reduction can be generalized by framing it in
terms of expected recruitment, and may provide a robust safeguard against recruitment overfishing.
The challenge is in estimating the maximum recruitment, analogous to previously mentioned
difficulties in estimating B<sub>0</sub>.</p>

<p>This recruitment-based reference point can be translated into either a biomass-based or 
F-based reference point. When cast as a biomass threshold, this reference point has an advantage over
biomass thresholds expressed as a fixed percentage of B<sub>0</sub>, in that it takes account of the degree of
compensation in the S-R relationship, setting more conservative (higher) thresholds for stocks with
lower compensatory reserve. Such methods should be preferred over the blanket adoption of 20%
B<sub>o</sub>, which is unlikely to be applicable across the entire range of observed levels of stock resilience.
However, rarely are there stock-recruitment data with sufficient contrast to estimate stock resilience
precisely. For example, Myers et al. (in press) found that the biomass at 50% R<sub>max</sub> sometimes
appeared overly risky, particularly when the available historical data exhibited zero or negative slope,
resulting in extremely high estimates of the slope at the origin of the S-R curve. Conversely, for data
exhibiting a positive slope overall, the method often estimated a threshold that was extremely large.
These problems are related more to a lack of contrast in the data and the validity of the fitted curve
than to the definition of the reference point itself.</p>

<p>When cast as an F-based threshold, a reference point based on relative expected recruitment
can be expressed in terms of equilibrium spawning per recruit, providing (as above) that the degree
of compensation in the S-R relationship can be estimated.</p>

<p>There are many cases where neither F nor B can be estimated explicitly, due to lack of data.
The only option in such situations is to develop proxies based on the type and quality of data that are
available. Proxies that may index F include truncated age distributions and small or decreasing mean
size in landings or measures of fishing effort; those indexing biomass include low commercial catch
per unit effort (CPUE) and low or markedly declining research survey indices. For example,
overfishing could be specified as a ratio of current commercial or research CPUE compared to the
CPUE of some historic period when the stock was lightly exploited. It is sometimes difficult to use
such proxies to develop measurable, unambiguous and meaningful overfishing definitions. Proxies
for F may be difficult to specify and interpret due to departures from a stable age distribution (e.g.,
a decrease in mean size may indicate a strong incoming year class rather than high F); proxies for
B may be difficult to specify, due to the problem of selecting a suitable base period and changing
catchability related to the efficiency of fishing or the distribution of the stock.</p>

<h3><a name="ch4.1.2">2. EXPRESSING THE LIMIT AS MORTALITY RATE OR BIOMASS</a></h3>

<p>One persuasive argument in favor of specifying the limit reference point for recruitment
overfishing as a maximum fishing mortality rate (F) is that it relates to the act of fishing and therefore
can be controlled directly. In fact, the amount and characteristics of fishing on the stock are the only
components of stock dynamics that can be controlled by management. However, the ultimate intent
of management with respect to conservation of the resource is to ensure that there is sufficient
spawning stock remaining after the harvest for the stock to sustain itself.</p>

<p>Reference points that give a maximum fishing mortality rate have the further advantages that:
(1) There is a theoretical and empirical basis for the selection of maximum F levels, such as F<sub>med</sub>,
F<sub>20%</sub>, or F<sub>35%</sub> (Goodyear 1977; 1980; 1989; 1993; Sissenwine and Shepherd 1987; Gabriel et al. 1989;
Clark 1991; Mace and Sissenwine 1993); (2) when the fishery is operating near the limit a maximum
harvest rate strategy may not result in fishery closures, but rather require substantial reductions in
catches or effort if the threshold is crossed; (3) an appropriate limit reference point can be estimated
from relatively sparse fishery data and information on the life history characteristics of the stock in
question; and (4) setting a maximum F can prevent the stock from depletion due to fishing in the long
term.</p>

<p>On the other hand, there are some disadvantages in limits specified in terms of a maximum
fishing mortality rate only. Maximum fishing mortality rate strategies do not increase the protection
afforded to the stock when it is in poor condition. An F-based definition that is appropriate over
some middle range of biomass levels, may not necessarily be appropriate at the extremes of biomass.
For example, a maximum harvest rate, such as F<sub>20%</sub>, set to prevent long-term decline of the stock
from its current level will not necessarily allow rebuilding of a stock that was seriously overfished
in the past. Nor will it allow a fishery to develop its full potential if estimated from data obtained
only from a period of light fishing. Further, changing environmental conditions and life history
characteristics may necessitate changing the threshold harvest rate in the definition.</p>

<p>Reference points that specify a minimum biomass level for the stock, below which the fishery
is curtailed or, in the extreme case, closed, have the advantages that: (1) Biomass is more directly
linked to recruitment than is the fishing mortality rate; (2) minimum biomass levels provide a guide
for management of stocks that are already depleted by setting a standard for rebuilding; and (3) during
periods of adverse environmental conditions, a minimum biomass level provides a seed stock for
eventual recovery when conditions are more favorable.</p>

<p>However, specifying minimum biomass levels can be difficult and is often more demanding
of the data than determining a maximum harvest rate. This is particularly true if the biomass
threshold is treated as absolute, i.e., the fishery is closed if the estimated biomass falls below the
threshold, rather than indicative, i.e., when the stock is below and indicative biomass threshold the
maximum allowable F is reduced. The problem of lack of observations over the full range of stock
conditions (i.e., lack of contrast in stock abundance or changing environmental conditions) may cause
the minimum biomass to be mis-estimated. The strategy of closing a fishery below a biomass limit
and opening it above may also result in highly variable fishery yields and economic dislocation.
Because the consequences of crossing an absolute biomass limit are so extreme, their use will often
be accompanied by intense controversy about the accuracy of stock size estimates. In addition,
managers and the public may misinterpret a biomass limit as the point at which the resource will
collapse, heightening the controversy.</p>

<p>While F-based reference points applied in a multispecies fishery afford some protection to the
suite of stocks fished, a biomass limit is, of necessity, set on a stock-by-stcok basis. A maximum
fishing mortality rate is needed for multispecies fisheries in particular, even if a minimum biomass
level is set for some of the principal species in the suite.</p>

<p>Using a combination of a maximum fishing mortality rate, a indicative biomass level below
which the maximum allowable fishing mortality rate is reduced, and an absolute minimum biomass
limit may provide good protection for the resource. This is illustrated, schematically in Figure 1 in
the form a harvest control law, such as are used for some U.S. Pacific coast stocks. The harvest
control law specifies a maximum fishing mortality rate for a stock in healthy condition, some strategy
for reducing F progressively as biomass falls below some precautionary level of stock biomass
(regardless of the reason for low stock size), and a (lower) absolute biomass threshold below which
fishing must cease or be restricted to bycatch only. The option of closing down a fishery when stocks
become severely depleted should always be retained. One way of incorporating such an absolute
biomass limit would be to set it arbitrarily low (e.g., 10% of current biomass) to be used as a
safeguard only in extreme situations of failed management, poor stock assessment or continuing
adverse environmental conditions that place the stock in jeopardy.</p>

<p>If a control law that reduces the fishing mortality rate gradually as biomass is reduced below
some designated precautionary level is used: (1) It affords additional protection for the resource when
stock condition is apparently poorer; (2) the consequences of mistakes in the specification or
estimation of reference points are not as serious; (3) relating F to biomass over some intermediate
range of biomass should allow more time and flexibility for evaluating whether the stock is in a
transition phase from one stationary state to another; (4) temporary reductions in biomass can be
accompanied by temporary reductions in F that need not result unnecessarily in permanent changes
in the composition or operation of the fishing fleet; and (5) small or gradual reductions (or increases)
in F will be less controversial, and therefore less subject to litigation.</p>

<h3><a name="ch4.1.3">3. THE ROLE OF UNCERTAINTY</a></h3>

<p>There are three principal sources of uncertainty with respect to the precautionary application
of limit reference points for fisheries. The first is the difficulty of adequately accounting for some
life history features in choosing the reference points. This means that there is uncertainty about the
dynamics of the stock. In effect the determination of a precautionary limit is uncertain because of
the difficulty of describing the relationship between stock and recruitment. As noted in the
introduction, the choice of a null hypothesis is crucial in dealing with uncertain stock dynamics. To
be cautious, it should be assumed that there is a linear relationship between stock and recruitment,
such that reductions in spawner abundance (increases in fishing pressure) will reduce stock
productivity directly. However, there will still be uncertainty about all parameters used to calculate
the reference points, e.g., growth and maturation rates, an that uncertainty needs to be accounted for
in application of any precautionary strategy.</p>

<p>A second major source of uncertainty that affects the use of precautionary reference points
is measurement error in the determination of the current state of the stock. For many stock
assessments, estimates of measurement errors are available and these should be used directly in
advising managers on the probability that a stock is overfished relative to a given reference point.
Such uncertainty is generally reduced with longer time series and more accurate and precise data. e.g.
for relative abundance indices. The benefits of reduced uncertainty when managing a stock under a
given harvest strategy show up most clearly in the expected variability of yield (Powers and Restrepo
1993) and the power and Type I error for detecting the probability of recruitment overfishing
(Rosenberg and Restrepo 1993)(here, Type I error refers to erroneously concluding that overfishing
is taking place). As would be expected, the statistical power of detecting overfishing is higher in
more precise assesments having a longer time series and higher contrast in abundance levels.
Similarly, the Type I error is lower for longer time series and higher contrast in abundance.</p>

<p>Assessment methods are subject to errors due to variability in input data and to model
mis-specifications. In some cases, errors tend to cancel. For example, the natural mortality rate M
is rarely known accurately, and errors in M result in systematic errors in assessments. However, if
a reference point is based on models using the same erroneous value of M, performance of the limit
reference point may prove to be robust.</p>

<p>A more disturbing possibility is the so-called &#8220;retrospective problem&#8221; (ICES 1991).
Experience has shown that assessment methods in some cases consistently overestimate or consistently
underestimate current abundance for a given stock, as compared with estimates based on subsequent
information. Causes for this phenomenon are many, including mis-specification of natural mortality
values, biased trends in relative abundance data, and other forms of model mis-specification such as
ignoring sexually-dimorphic growth. As stocks approach a condition of being overfished, assessment
methods may be prone to Type I and Type II errors (falsely indicating recruitment overfishing when
it is not occurring or failing to indicate overfishing when it is occurring), due to the &#8220;retrospective
problem.&#8221;  The error may be recognized only after passage of several years. This leads to the
question of how management should address such retrospective errors, especially when there is reason
to believe the error is an ongoing phenomenon.</p>

<p>A third source of uncertainty relates to possibly changing environmental conditions that affect
stock productivity. Such environmental changes may mean that the value of the limit reference point
must be changed, but it is difficult to detect and forecast environmental trends and their impacts.
Most stock assessment models and overfishing definitions assume that life history characteristics are
constant and that long-term changes in stock abundance are determined principally through a
stationary stock-recruitment relationship. Short-term fluctuations in the environment introduce
variability into the stock-recruitment relationship, but do not create a fundamental problem for the
analysis. However, long-term trends in the environment and changes in the density-dependent nature
of individual growth and egg production can change the shape and scale of the stock-recruitment
curve. The short duration of most time series hinders unambiguous detection of these trends and
changes. In a short time series, the stock is typically observed over only a narrow range of
abundance. The resulting lack of contrast in stock-recruitment data can lead to large measurement
error in estimates of biological reference points, and to estimates of biological reference points that
may not be applicable to other levels of stock abundance or environmental conditions. While
extending the time series can alleviate problems caused by lack of data contrast, it can exacerbate
problems caused by long-term trends in the environment.</p>

<p>Limit reference points based on an absolute minimum biomass level differ from definitions
based on a maximum fishing mortality rate in terms of their ability to protect a stock during
prolonged periods of adverse environmental conditions. A minimum biomass threshold may be
preferable, because it can protect a stock until there is sufficient information on production capacity.
However, if the environmental carrying capacity for new recruits alone has changed (i.e., if the slope
at the origin of the stock-recruitment curve is unchanged), then the new climate regime may not
change the appropriate fishing mortality rate. In this case, a reference point based on maximum
fishing mortality rate would be robust; the corresponding yield and biomass levels would simply be
scaled up or down by the change in recruitment potential.</p>

<p>All assessment methodologies contain some amount of error and/or bias. One aspect of the
performance of a methodology for setting a limit reference point is its ability to identify accurately
a condition of overfishing, even when implemented according to imprecise or inaccurate stock
assessments. This property can be called robustness. It is important to evaluate the robustness of not
just the method for setting a limit reference point, but the performance of the entire management
procedure used for the stock, meaning everything from data collection and analysis, to the assessment
results and their use in combination with target and limit reference points in harvest control laws.
The reason for this is that there is feedback between all parts of the system (stock-management) over
time: today's decisions affect tomorrow's outcomes and, therefore, tomorrow's decisions. The
robustness of a management procedure can be best evaluated through simulation experiments, as
advocated by, e.g., de la Mare (1986), Rosenberg and Restrepo (1993), and Restrepo and Rosenberg
(1994).</p>

<p>Because all of the various sources of uncertainty interact, managers should choose a &#8220;decision
rule&#8221; that sets an acceptable probability of recruitment overfishing, given the uncertainty in knowledge
of the true dynamics of the stock, the estimates of current stock status, and the possibility of
environmental trends. The acceptable probability of overfishing is related to the time frame
considered, the consequences of crossing the limit reference point, and the action to be taken if it is
concluded the stock is overfished. For example, a given probability of overfishing might be
acceptable if the only consequence is a slightly increased risk of poor recruitment in one year.
However, the same probability might not be acceptable if there was thought to be a high chance of
recruitment failure that would affect the fishery for several years to come. Similarly, if the actions
taken upon crossing the threshold are likely to redress the situation quickly (e.g., if crossing a
maximum F threshold is followed by corresponding quota reductions), then the decision rule may
allow a higher probability of overfishing than if the action is merely to begin a 20 year gradual
decrease in fishing.</p>

<p>Thus, an important consideration is that all limit reference points are not created equal in
terms of their inherent degree of cautiousness. As shown by Rosenberg and Restrepo (1993), there
is little to be gained by setting a very low allowable probability of overfishing if a very cautious limit
reference point is being used. On the other hand, overfishing could be avoided by setting a low
allowable probability of overfishing when the limit reference point is not very cautious.</p>

<p>These types of uncertainties and the need for a decision rule on the acceptable probability of
overfishing apply to both F-based and biomass-based thresholds. A control law that reduces the
fishing mortality rate gradually as biomass is reduced below some designated precautionary level, as
advocated in the previous section, can incorporate decisions based on the perceived uncertainty in
stock status and the reference point (Restrepo and Rosenberg, 1994). For instance, the control law
may reduce F in inverse proportion to the estimated probability that the stock is below a precautionary
biomass-based threshold.</p>

<p>Estimates of stock status and the appropriate limit reference level to prevent recruitment
overfishing will always be uncertain and engender substantial argument in management fora. Because
of this, the management actions to be taken if the overfishing definition threshold is crossed should
be explicitly stated in conjunction with the chosen decision rule. It is important that the
determination of management actions be made prior to reaching the limit, so that action to protect the
stock is not delayed. If this is done, and the reference point is chosen conservatively, then the time
for the stock to recover from any short period of overfishing should be short. It is recommended that
the expected time for a stock to recover from the limit level to the target level be considered in
developing limit reference points. Calculations should be done to estimate how rapidly recovery
could occur with high probability if the fishery were closed. For example, in the event of recruitment
overfishing a rebuilding program could be designed to result in a high probability of recovery in not
more than one generation longer than the time needed under a complete closure.</p>

<h2><a name="ch4.2">CONCLUSIONS</a></h2>


<p>Precautionary management reference points are those intended to prevent recruitment
overfishing, even if a direct link between spawning stock size and subsequent recruitment cannot be
established statistically.</p>

<p>In order to be precautionary, the appropriate null hypothesis is that spawning biomass or egg
production is linearly related to recruitment, i.e., that the stock does not compensate for reduced
abundance by increasing productivity. A null hypothesis of average constant recruitment at all stock
sizes (slope = 0), prevalent in the minds of many scientists and managers, can result in continued
harvesting until a major decline in recruitment at low adult biomass occurs, the antithesis of
precaution.</p>

<p>Limit reference points for biological conservation should set the constraints within which a
management strategy must operate. A number of limit reference points related to recruitment
overfishing have been developed based on theoretical or empirical work, or both, as detailed in the
second section above. In some cases these are expressed in terms of fishing mortality rates and in
other cases in terms of biomass. Both ways of expressing limits have advantages and disadvantages
and how a particular limit definition performs could be case-specific. However, it is unlikely that
a single limit reference point can provide protection for the resource under all foreseeable
circumstances and, thus, it is useful to define harvest control laws which combine several thresholds.
For instance, using a combination of a maximum fishing mortality rate, a precautionary biomass level
below which the maximum allowable fishing mortality rate is reduced, and an absolute minimum
biomass limit (Figure 1) may provide good protection for the resource.</p>

<p align="center"><b>A schematic harvest control law</b></p>

<p>In this example, the dashed line represents a target fishing mortality rate which may vary as a function of stock
size. A stock biomass value of 2 corresponds to an absolute biomass threshold. Biomass levels below this value indicate
that the stock is overfished. The solid line represents a threshold fishing mortality, or the maximum allowable F. F values
above this line indicate overfishing. A stock biomass value of 4 corresponds to a precautionary biomass level below which
the maximum allowable F is reduced.</p>

<p>A precautionary management strategy should contain, in addition to limit reference points,
a priori decision rules on the acceptable probability (risk) that recruitment overfishing will take place,
given the target harvest and the estimated stock status. If the acceptable probability of overfishing
is not defined a priori, or if it is redefined with every new assessment, it becomes inevitable that
higher risks will be taken at low stock sizes in order to maintain stable catches. What constitutes a
reasonable decision on the acceptable probability of overfishing is likely to be case-specific, depending
on the life-history characteristics of the stock in question, in particular on its resilience to fishing.</p>

<p>All of this can - and should - be investigated from available data and simulation studies. The choice
for a particular definition should also be tied to uncertainty and precautionary management dictates
that more uncertain situations require more conservative measures.</p>
